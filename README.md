Well, basically my first go at using Git to host my code and eventually collaborate on the  Project! This first challenge is about a store manager web app that helps store owners manage sales and product inventory records.
This project kicks off with a set of User interfaces that are created using HTML and CSS, jAVASCRIPT is also used but its used here is quite limited and not yet functional.
The full planning for this project was done using Pivortal Tracker.
Most work has been done offline and changes committed to GitHub using the Git software for windows.

## Features 
- Store attendant can search and add products to the cart.
- Store attendant can see his/her sales records but cannot edit or delete them.
- The application shows available products, quantity in stock and price.
- Store owner/admin can see the sales and filter by attendants who cashed it out.
- Store owner/admin can add, modify and delete products.
- Store owner/admin can give admin rights to the store attendant.
- Products should be put in categories.
- Store owners should be able to add products to specific categories.

## Getting Started

- Well, knwledge of CSS and HTML is needed.
- A laptop, determination and some love for the project that you are about to under take.

## Needs
-Git for windows i.e GitBash
-Code Editor of your choice
